## Matt#8280 - Twitter Bot
Having enjoyed building Discord bots in Javascript, I have always wanted to experiment with building a twitter bot and #30DayProject 
seems like the ideal time. It should be an interesting project as I have never worked with the twitter API before. 
Im not 100% sure on the features yet, I will define that once I get to grips with the basics. Feel free to connect with me on 
Twitter/Linkedin, where I will likely document my journey alongside Discord!

## Brian(Brew)#9228 - Gatsby-Portfolio
I have been debating on creating a blog for a long time and decided I wanted to build it right into my portfolio.  My old portfolio used just html/css and javascript. In order to update it I decided to move it to gatsby so I could take advantage of react and some of the really nice things gatsby does for data and static pages

## Bijayadhs#1274  -  168Hours
###I was on tutorial purgatory since last year. I don't have any project to show off. As I have a fulltime job in restaurant, I couldn't able to give my full focus on building stuff. I was trying to put my schedule on paper on a weekly basis that gave me some kind of productivity. I want to build an app that will track your schedule for a whole week, every hour what you invest on so that it will give you overall feedback what you have done and what you can change the future. I want to build this new web application with html, css, js, react and nodejs. #30DayProject  :+1:
